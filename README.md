🧠 Brain Tumor Classification Using K-NN | This project classifies MRI brain scans into tumor/non-tumor using image processing and K-NN. It involves preprocessing, feature extraction, and similarity-based classification to aid early detection. The system enhances diagnostic accuracy, serving as a decision-support tool for radiologists. 🔍✨
