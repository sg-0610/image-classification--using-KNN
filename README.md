Brain Tumor Classification Using K-NN 🧠🔍

Overview

This project focuses on brain tumor classification using image processing and machine learning, specifically the K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) algorithm. The goal is to develop a system that accurately classifies MRI brain scans into tumor and non-tumor categories, aiding early detection and diagnosis.

Project Objectives 🎯

Image Preprocessing – Convert MRI scans to grayscale, remove noise, and enhance edges.

Feature Extraction – Identify key texture and intensity patterns for classification.

K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) – Classify images based on similarity to labeled examples.

Performance Evaluation – Assess accuracy, precision, and recall using a benchmark dataset.

Why K-NN? 🤖

Simple yet effective – Relies on similarity-based classification.

Non-parametric – No need for assumptions about data distribution.

Adaptability – Performs well with small datasets and customizable distance metrics.
